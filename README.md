- 👋 Hi, I’m @patrickegon.
  Graduated in Natural Sciences: Biology, at the State University of Pará. 
  
  Served as an intern with two Scientific Initiation Scholarship from the Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC) at the Center for Technological Innovations (CIT/IEC) (2013-2015).
  
  Masters degree in Biodiversity, Genetics and Evolution on (FCUP/CIIMAR)(2018-2023).
  
  Experience with viral genome assembly, curation and annotation, metabarcoding analysis (Virus, Protist, Bacteria and Archaea), molecular techniques and programing applied to biological data.


- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, Data science, Bioinformatics, Molecular Biology, Statistics, Data Mining, Large Data Volume Management, Programming Languages (R, Python and Shell Script) applied to bioinformatics analysis with data generated from NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) platforms such as GS FLX 454 Sequencing, ION PGM Sequencing and Illumina Mi-seq.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning R applied on metabarcoding data. Filtering, splitting, analysing and plotting graphs, tables and maps.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data science and Bioinformatics projects.

## Work Experience
**Freelance Data Analyst & Scientist @ Freelance | (_January 2022 – Present_)**
- Data analysis projects focused on delivering actionable insights.
- Emphasis on improving operational efficiency.
- End-to-end project examples in healthcare and retail.
- Leveraging ETL (Python/SQL/Bash/R), statistical modeling (R), and data visualization (R).
- Showcases process automation skills with Python/APIs.
- Proven ability to reduce analysis time and optimize operations.

**Biodiversity and Data Researcher @ University of Porto (CIIMAR/FCUP) | (_January 2019–2023_)**
​- Climate Change Impact on Arctic Microorganism Diversity: Led data collection, processing, and analysis to evaluate the effects of increased salinity and acidity in Arctic currents on microorganism diversity, assessing outbreaks and local risks. 
- Microbial Community Distribution via ML: Trained ML models to identify distribution patterns and correlations within microbial communities.
- Automated Climate Impact Analyses: Automated statistical modeling and ML analyses (Bash/R/Python) to generate climate impact insights.
- +20% Workflow Efficiency: Optimized data workflows (transformation/filtering/visualization), achieving a +20% efficiency increase.
- Arctic Biodiversity & Policy Reports: Produced strategic reports informing biodiversity and policy decisions in the Arctic.

**Junior Data Analyst (Scholarship) @ Evandro Chagas Institute  (_June 2015–2016 July _)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis (via ETL) for a novel study evaluating the impact of viruses on Yellow Fever outbreak risk patterns.
- Analyzed data with statistical techniques and predictive models (Python/Shell) to predict live-fire training scenarios and detect endemic outbreak patterns using trained ML models.
- Identified data analysis improvement opportunities and generated strategic reports.
- Provided big data insights (pre/post-processing and quality) to decision-makers.
- Actively contributed to the development of ETL processes and predictive models in the IEC Data Engineering department.
- Applied supervised deep learning to endemic data to discover potential novel distribution areas of new Yellow Fever strains in the Americas.

** Junior Data Analyst @ Evandro Chagas Institute (_June 2014–2015 July _)**
- Conducted novel data collection, processing, and analysis (via ETL in Python/Bash) to evaluate the impact of viruses on Rabies and other bat-related disease outbreak risk patterns using metabarcoding data and trained ML models. 
- Analyzed data with statistical techniques and predictive models to detect endemic outbreak patterns.
- Identified data analysis improvement opportunities and generated strategic reports.
