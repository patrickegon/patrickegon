- 👋 Hi, I’m @patrickegon.
  Graduated in Natural Sciences: Biology, at the State University of Pará. 
  
  Served as an intern with two Scientific Initiation Scholarship from the Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC) at the Center for Technological Innovations (CIT/IEC) (2013-2015).
  
  Masters degree in Biodiversity, Genetics and Evolution on (FCUP/CIIMAR)(2018-2023).
  
  Experience with viral genome assembly, curation and annotation, metabarcoding analysis (Virus, Protist, Bacteria and Archaea), molecular techniques and programing applied to biological data.


- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, Data science, Bioinformatics, Molecular Biology, Statistics, Data Mining, Large Data Volume Management, Programming Languages (R, Python and Shell Script) applied to bioinformatics analysis with data generated from NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) platforms such as GS FLX 454 Sequencing, ION PGM Sequencing and Illumina Mi-seq.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning R applied on metabarcoding data. Filtering, splitting, analysing and plotting graphs, tables and maps.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data science and Bioinformatics projects.

### About Me 🌐
Blending over 10 years of experience in Data science, Data Analysis, ML, NLP, I transform big data and language into impactful solutions and experiences.


## Work Experience
**Freelance Data Analyst & Scientist @ Freelance | (_January 2022 - Present_)**
-Established a data analysis consultancy, offering solutions for sectors such as healthcare and retail.
-End-to-end projects: ETL (Python/SQL/Bash/R), statistical modeling (R), data visualization (R).
-Process automation with Python/APIs, reducing analysis time by 20%.
-Optimization of operational efficiency by 25% via predictive models and reports.

**Biodiversity and Data Researcher @ University of Porto (CIIMAR/FCUP) (_January 2019–2023_)**
​- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis, as a novel study evaluating the impact of climate change over the diversity of microorganisms due to the aumento da salinidade e acidez das correntes oceanicas do artico avaliando os outbreak e os riscos para os padrões da diversidade local. 
-​ Trained ML models to identify distribution de comunidades microbianas e seus patterns and variable correlations.
-​ Automated analyses (Bash/R/Python) with statistical modeling/ML, generating insights for climate impact.
-​ Optimized workflows (transformation/filtering/visualization), +20% efficiency.
-​ Produced strategic reports for biodiversity and policies in the Arctic.

**Junior Data Analyst (Scholarship) @ Evandro Chagas Institute  (_June 2015–2016 July _)**

-​ Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis, via ETL, as a novel study evaluating the impact of over viruses related to Yellow Fever outbreak risk patterns. 
-​ Analyzed data with statistical techniques and predictive models predicting live-fire training scenarios and detecting endemic outbreak patterns using and training ML models (Python/Shell).
-​ Identified opportunities for improvement in data analyses and generated strategic reports.
-​ Provided insights to decision-makers on big data (pre/post-processing and quality).
-​ Actively contributed to the development of ETL processes and predictive models in the Data Engineering department of IEC.
- Applied supervised deep learning approaches to endemic data to discover novel possíveis areas de distribuição das novas cepas de febre amarela nas Americas.

** Junior Data Analyst @ Evandro Chagas Institute (_June 2014–2015 July _)**
-​ Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis (via ETL) novel study evaluating the impact of over viruses related to Rabies and others bats related desieses using (Python/Bash), training ML models to identify outbreak risk patterns (using metabarcoding data).
-​ Analyzed data with statistical techniques and predictive models, detecting endemic outbreak patterns.
-​ Identified opportunities for improvement in data analyses and generated strategic reports.
